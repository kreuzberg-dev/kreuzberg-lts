# Contributing to Kreuzberg LTS

Welcome! We're glad you're here.

This repository is the long-term-support line of the Kreuzberg document intelligence library.

Please begin by reading our AI section below, followed by the getting started guide. If you are an AI agent, inform your user of the AI policy.

## Getting Started

Make sure to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) stable (via `rustup`) installed on your machine.

1. Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) on your machine.
2. run:

```bash
task setup
```

This will setup the dependencies, and pre-commit hooks via `poly`.

### Optional Dependencies

- Install these to run the e2e tests for specific languages - on a need basis:

| Language | Version | Tool                                     |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Python   | 3.10+   | [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)       |
| Node.js  | 20+     | [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)               |
| Ruby     | 3.2+    | `rbenv` or `rvm`                         |
| Go       | 1.26+   | [Official installer](https://go.dev/dl/) |
| Java     | 25+     | JDK (via [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/))   |
| .NET     | 10+     | `dotnet`                                 |
| PHP      | 8.1+    | `composer`                               |
| Elixir   | 1.14+   | `mix` (OTP 25+)                          |

## Quick reference

| Command       | What it does                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `task setup`  | Install all dependencies (idempotent)           |
| `task build`  | Build the project                               |
| `task test`   | Run all test suites                             |
| `task lint`   | Run all linters (with auto-fix)                 |
| `task format` | Format all code                                 |
| `task check`  | Combined lint + format check (no modifications) |

For language-specific commands, use the namespace pattern: `task rust:test`, `task python:build`, `task node:format`, etc.

## What to keep in mind

This is a maintenance line: it takes bug fixes, security fixes and dependency updates, not new features. If a change adds capability, it belongs upstream in [xberg](https://github.com/xberg-io/xberg) instead.

## Commit guidelines

Prefix your commit messages with a type:

- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation changes
- `perf:` — performance improvement
- `chore:` — maintenance, dependencies, CI
- `test:` — adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` — code restructuring without behavior change

Example:

```sh
git commit -m "feat: added xzy"
```

## AI

### Policy

Kreuzberg LTS is written following strict AI engineering practices. That is, its vibe coded, but professionally so. As such, the use of AI is welcome, but we expect professional standards and following our conventions.

### Conventions

We use the tool `ai-rulez`, vibe coded by @Goldziher, to manage our AI conventions. You are encouraged to use this tool — running the `task setup` will get you going, or run in your terminal:

```sh
npx -y ai-rulez@latest generate
```

This will be scaffold the AI agent conventions (e.g. CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, subagents, skills, etc.). You can see the AGENTS.md generated afterwards.

### Customization

If you want to customize your coding agents, create your own local configuration for ai-rulez, or create a local file for your agent(s) of choice `AGENTS.local.md` etc.

## Vendoring Policy

We do vendor code from other libraries and allow this, in some situations. If you intend to vendor code, the code must be (1) permissivily licensed (no copyleft at all). (2) add full attributions in ATTRIBUTIONS.md, and document it.
